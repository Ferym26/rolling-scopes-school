					p.text Las Meninas is a 1656 painting by Diego Vel√°zquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.
					p.text It was cleaned in 1984 to remove a #[span.accent "yellow veil"] of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.
					p.text The cleaning provoked furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different.
